## Project insights
Loan Applications & Disbursement
- Loan applications showed Month-over-Month growth, with peak volumes observed in Q2.
- Approval rates were higher among salaried applicants than self-employed individuals.
- Urban regions recorded the highest number of applications and disbursed amounts.

Funded Amount & Repayments
- Total funded amount increased steadily, while repayment collections had seasonal fluctuations.
- Month-to-Date (MTD) repayment amounts improved, indicating enhanced borrower follow-up and engagement.

Borrower Profile Trends
- Borrowers with lower Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios displayed more consistent repayment behavior.
- Applicants with a recorded credit history had significantly higher loan approval rates.
- Education level had limited impact on approvals but influenced average loan size.

Risk & Defaults
- Bad loans were concentrated in long-term, high-value loans with limited borrower income.
- Higher DTI ratios were strongly associated with default cases.
- Rural property loans showed a higher share of defaults compared to urban and semi-urban areas.

Interest Rate Trends
- Average interest rates remained stable across segments.
- Slightly lower rates were offered to high-value, low-risk borrowers, reflecting risk-based pricing strategies.
