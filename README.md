# Hospital-Emergency-Room-
## Purpose of project
We need to create a Hospital emergency room analysis in excel to improve efficiency and provide useful insights. This dashboard will help stakeholders monitor, analyze, and make better decisions for managing patients and improving services.

## Dataset 
- <a href="https://github.com/Richa-goyal06/Hospital-Emergency-Room-/blob/main/Hospital%20Emergency%20Room%20Data%20(1).csv">Dataset</a>
## KPI'S Requirements
- No. of patients
- Average wait time
- Patient satisfaction score

## Process
- Queried and extracted raw loan data using SQL from a MySQL database.
- Cleaned, transformed, and modeled data using Power Pivot in Excel.
- Created calculated fields such as DTI and interest-based KPIs.
- Built an interactive Excel dashboard using pivot tables, charts, and slicers.
- Analyzed trends across loan approvals, repayments, defaults, and risk segments.

## Project insights
Loan Applications & Disbursement
- Loan applications showed Month-over-Month growth, with peak volumes observed in Q2.
- Approval rates were higher among salaried applicants than self-employed individuals.
- Urban regions recorded the highest number of applications and disbursed amounts.

Funded Amount & Repayments
- Total funded amount increased steadily, while repayment collections had seasonal fluctuations.
- Month-to-Date (MTD) repayment amounts improved, indicating enhanced borrower follow-up and engagement.

Borrower Profile Trends
- Borrowers with lower Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios displayed more consistent repayment behavior.
- Applicants with a recorded credit history had significantly higher loan approval rates.
- Education level had limited impact on approvals but influenced average loan size.

Risk & Defaults
- Bad loans were concentrated in long-term, high-value loans with limited borrower income.
- Higher DTI ratios were strongly associated with default cases.
- Rural property loans showed a higher share of defaults compared to urban and semi-urban areas.

Interest Rate Trends
- Average interest rates remained stable across segments.
- Slightly lower rates were offered to high-value, low-risk borrowers, reflecting risk-based pricing strategies.

## Final conclusions
Developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze loan performance, uncover borrower risk patterns, and support data-driven lending decisions
